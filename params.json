All you need is one mod to handle getting all the other mods\r\n\r\nAs for server owners, you only need to do one thing to support Coherence: drag the mod into your mods folder. That's it. It'll handle all the distribution for you.\r\n\r\n### Efficient\r\nCoherence caches the mods on the client side, so when the server updates its mods, Coherence only downloads the new mods.\r\n\r\n### Configuring\r\nCoherence automatically pulls the config files from the server, too. No manual mod configuring required.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
